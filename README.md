# LMG 2048






## Description
2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048.

The purpose of this creating this project was because it was our first project in our TechWise program.

We had to follow these rules when creating the game:

* 2048 is played on a 4 x 4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide smoothly when a player moves them using the four arrow keys by choosing a direction (up, down, left or right).
* Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4.
* If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move. Higher-scoring tiles emit a soft glow.
* If a move causes three consecutive tiles of the same value to slide together, only the two tiles the farthest along the direction of motion will combine.
* If all four spaces in a row or column are filled with tiles of the same value, a move parallel to that row/column will combine the first two and last two.
* The user's score starts at zero, and is increased whenever two tiles combine, by the value of the new tile.
* The game is won when a tile with a value of 2048 appears on the board.
